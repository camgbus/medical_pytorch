        the image.

        performed around the origin in world coordinates.
    - default_pad_value: As the image is rotated, some values near the
        borders will be undefined. If 'minimum', the fill value will
        be the image minimum. If 'mean', the fill value is the mean of
        the border values. If 'otsu', the fill value is the mean of the
